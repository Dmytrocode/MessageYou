## Installation
If you wish to build this application in your local machine, there are a certain steps to follow:

ATTENTION: Before proceeding, make sure that your expo-cli and NPM/Yarn Package Manager is up to date. 
I strongly suggest using YARN instead of NPM as I found multiple bugs and problems using npm to install packages and libraries.

If you don't have expo-cli installed, Feel free to use:
```
$ yarn global add expo-cli
```

Clone the application in your own local directory:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Dmytrocode/MessageYou.git
```
Install the Navigation, Elements, and Gesture Gandler libraries
```
$ yarn add react-native-gesture-handler
$ yarn add @react-navigation/native 
Dependencies:
$ expo install react-native-reanimated react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view
```
MORE INFORMATION: https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/


After installing the libraries and dependencies, you are free to run the project using:
```
$ yarn start
```


This application can be simulated in an Android Device. You can use Android Studio to setup virtual Android devices.
